They get their name from the fact that they have a smooth, \"silky\" texture. Silky sharks mostly eat bony fish such as tuna, mackerel, and sardines. Research has suggested that they are highly responsive to particular sounds, which may be related to how they look for sources of food.</div><div>In some parts of the world, silky sharks are fished. They are also frequently caught as bycatch, meaning they are accidentally caught while another species is being fished.

Christopher Columbus gave the area its name when he explored it in the 15th century, to honour the Queen of Spain at that time. The area is sometimes known as the “crown jewel of the Caribbean”. It is famous for its rich underwater life. The water around these islands forms one of the healthiest marine ecosystems in the world, made up of coral reefs and mangroves. The Gardens of the Queen has been a protected marine reserve since 1996. One of the ways the area is protected is by limiting the access of ships, as these could damage the plants and animals in the water. This protection has allowed the area to thrive, with the numbers of fish increasing by 50% since protection began, and continuing to grow. The protection involves cooperation from the government, marine biologists, and local businesses. It is seen as a very successful example of conservation management. Some of the animals found here include American crocodiles, hawksbill turtles, Caribbean reef sharks, silky sharks, and many more. The large number of sharks in the Gardens of the Queen is a good indicator of a healthy environment, as sharks are a fragile species.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Questions</b> - Why is it important to protect Cuba's Gardens of the Queen?<br></div></div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>"
